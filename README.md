 Public API Requests

 Request a JSON Object from an API Server to grab 12 random "employees", and use that
 data to build a prototype for an employee directory.

 The data is parsed so that 12 employees are listed in a grid with their thumbnail image, full name, email, and location.
 Clicking the employee’s card will open a modal window with more detailed information, such as the employee’s birthday and address.
